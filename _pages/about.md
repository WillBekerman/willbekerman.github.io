Hi! Iâ€™m Will Bekerman, a rising first year PhD student at xxx in Statistics studying machine learning advised by Prof. xxx and Prof. xxx.

I graduated from Cornell University in May 2022, where I was named a Merril Presidential Scholar and Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar. I studied Biometry & Statistics with a focus in mathematical statistics, and my research was advised by the awesome Prof. [Joe Guinness](http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/).

Previously, I have been fortunate enough to work with Prof. Jianhua Hu and Prof. Xinlei Mi on ML for drug discovery and Uncertainty Quantification and with Prof. Madhur Srivastava on biomedical imaging.
