Hi! Iâ€™m Will Bekerman, a rising first year PhD student at xxx in Statistics studying causal inference advised by Prof. xxx and Prof. xxx.

I graduated from Cornell University in May 2022, where I was named a Merril Presidential Scholar and Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar. I studied Biometry & Statistics with a focus in mathematical statistics, and my research was advised by the awesome Prof. [Joe Guinness](http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/).

I have also been fortunate enough to work with Prof. [Jianhua Hu](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jh3992) and Prof. [Xinlei Mi](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=50312) on scRNA-seq data analysis and with Prof. [Madhur Srivastava](https://chemistry.cornell.edu/madhur-srivastava-) on wavelet denoising for biomedical imaging.
