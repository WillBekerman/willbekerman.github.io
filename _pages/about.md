Hi! Iâ€™m William Bekerman, a third-year PhD student in Statistics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania working with Prof. [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/).

My research interests include causal inference, the design and analysis of observational studies, and applications to areas such as health and public policy. My work is supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from Cornell University, where I was named a [Merril Presidential Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/about-scl/awards-funding/merrill-presidential-scholars-program) and [Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/cornell-commitment/rawlings-cornell-presidential-research-scholars). I studied Biometry & Statistics with a focus in mathematical statistics, and my research was advised by the incredible Prof. [Joe Guinness](http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/).
