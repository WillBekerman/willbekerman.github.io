Hi! Iâ€™m Will Bekerman, a first year PhD student in Statistics at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania currently working with Prof. [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/).

Recently, I was announced as a recipient of the [2022 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and I am incredibly thankful for the support of my research moving forward.

I graduated from Cornell University in May 2022, where I was named a [Merril Presidential Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/about-scl/awards-funding/merrill-presidential-scholars-program) and [Hunter R. Rawlings III Cornell Presidential Research Scholar](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/cornell-commitment/rawlings-cornell-presidential-research-scholars). I studied Biometry & Statistics with a focus in mathematical statistics, and my research was advised by the incredible Prof. [Joe Guinness](http://guinness.cals.cornell.edu/).

I have also been fortunate to work with Prof. [Jianhua Hu](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/jh3992) and Prof. [Xinlei Mi](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/faculty-profiles/az/profile.html?xid=50312) on scRNA-seq data analysis and with Prof. [Madhur Srivastava](https://chemistry.cornell.edu/madhur-srivastava) on wavelet denoising for biomedical imaging.
